## What is it?

Rias UserBot is a modular Telegram userbot running on Python 3.8+ with an SQLAlchemy database.

Based on [Cosmic](https://github.com/SkyLab-Devs/CosmicUserbot) UserBot.
I made this just for myself with the module that I actually use.

## Disclaimer
```
#include <std/disclaimer.h>
/**
      Your Telegram account may get Fucked-Up.
      I'm not responsible for any shit use of this bot.
      This bot is intended for the purpose of having fun with memes,
      as well as efficiently managing groups.
      You ended up spamming groups, getting reported left and right,
      and you ended up in a Finale Battle with Telegram and at the end
      Telegram Team deleted your account?
      And after that, then you pointed your fingers at us
      for getting your acoount deleted?
      I will be rolling on the floor laughing at you.
